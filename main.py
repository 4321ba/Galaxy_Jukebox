# TODO-s:
# custom instruments (command block playsound?, bool option for cmdblk/dontinclude)
# sign text (min render distance, name of the song)
# dummy splitline, and fix the right side ending/last part to be symmetric with left side
# maybe some more explanation for methods
# thank lithium+sodium dev
# todo-s in split_lines
# bool redstonelamp or tripwire, to reduce lag bc of lighting updates
# go back to original mcschematic

# upload to pip, and gui
