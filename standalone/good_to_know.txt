So I compiled the 1.0.0 version binaries using Python 3.8.10, which still works for Windows 7 and Ubuntu 20.04 (idk if they'd work above 3.8), I also needed to compile with ubuntu 20.04 (and not 22.04), so that the created elf file doesn't depend on too new glibc (objdump -T galaxy-jukebox-gui.bin)
python 3.8 was the last version for win7, so my guess is that above that it wouldn't work the compiled version either

However mcschematic officially only supports python3.9 and above, so you'll need to modify standalone/virt_env/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mcschematic/mcschematic.py, and add this to the very first line: "from __future__ import annotations", then it works with python3.8 as well

also, installing pyqt5 may hang, because older pip versions can't accept the license, so make sure pip is >=21.1.1 (that works for sure)

nuitka complains about the pyqt5 compilation being buggy, so if there's some problem with the interface, that may be it, but I didn't notice anything bad so I guess it should be ok

for the windows compilation, I used wine, specifically Bottles:
steps:
create a new application bottle
change win version to win 7
install python3.8.10 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/) (add it to path!)
git clone https://github.com/4321ba/Galaxy_Jukebox somewhere where the bottle finds it
launch cmd.exe with bottles and cd into the standalone dir
give the commands out one by one that are in the bat file
nuitka will download dependencies automatically, let that happen, however, depends.exe will miss mfc42.dll (and the 64 bit version! so installing vcredist6 or vcredist6sp6 is not enough!) I solved this by downloading one from here:
https://www.dll-files.com/mfc42.dll.html
the one with the md5 sum of 3c7e6036a7edf123fb4f0ff7ccd9d6a6 worked for me, and virustotal.com said it is the original from microsoft, so it should definitely be ok
I placed it next to depends.exe, so it can find it (AppData/Local/Nuitka/Nuitka/Cache/downloads/depends/x86_64/mfc42.dll)
