# TODO-s:

# upload to pip, and gui 

# make readme fancier, screenshot, etc
to readme:
install through pip
gui screenshot
minecraft screenshot
how to run as cmdline program (own command vs python3 -m)
how to run from a python script (for the converter)
maybe a small tutorial for the gui as well / explaining the screenshot
link back and forth (cli/gui), and for pypi as well (no duplication between readmes! for more info, read the other readme)


# create standalone executable, and release
for windows and maybe for linux

# make video (+world)

#adding these to readme:
# maybe support for custom instruments (command block playsound and bool option for including it or not)
# support for different volumes, panning (position of the noteblock, dummy splitline), and maybe pitch fine tuning (command block playsound)
