# TODO-s:

# upload to pip, and gui 

# make readme fancier, screenshot, etc

# create standalone executable, and release

# make video (+world)

#adding these to readme:
# maybe support for custom instruments (command block playsound and bool option for including it or not)
# support for different volumes, panning (position of the noteblock, dummy splitline), and maybe pitch fine tuning (command block playsound)
