# Galaxy Jukebox

Schematic exporter for Minecraft Noteblock Studio, making a galaxy-shaped jukebox that plays the song.

## Current state

The program is mostly feature complete, but it still needs cleanup.

## Minecraft version

The program currently needs 1.14 for:

- scaffolding (1gt delay, there are [other designs too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0xOAOM_R0Y), but this seems the best)
- smooth granite/andesite slab (aesthetics)
- birch sign (because we need 1.14, the sign has to have a woodtype)
- all the noteblock sounds (there isn't any check present whether they are available)
- 1.13 is maybe needed for the .schem support (and blockstates) in WorldEdit/etc., idk
- 1.13 for jungle wood
