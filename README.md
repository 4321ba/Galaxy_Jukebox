# Galaxy Jukebox

Schematic exporter for Minecraft Noteblock Studio, making a galaxy-shaped jukebox that plays the song.

Works with old and new versions of the nbs format, and outputs version 2 of Sponge schematic (it works with WorldEdit e.g.).

## Usage

### Installing dependencies

You'll need to install Python3. (Don't forget to add it to path!)

This program also requires `nbtlib` and `pynbs` to be installed:

```sh
pip3 install nbtlib pynbs
```

### Batch converting

There is a quick little script included for converting one or more files: you can paste the `.nbs` files inside the root folder (`Galaxy_Jukebox` or `Galaxy_Jukebox-main` probably), and double click `batch_convert.py`.

If everything is setup correctly, soon you should see the output files in the same directory (it takes a couple of seconds for the conversion).

If it doesn't work, you'll probably see nothing, in that case you should try it through the command line to see the error:

```sh
python3 batch_convert.py
```

### Converting one file from command line

If you want to specify the input and output file, you to convert any kind of `.nbs` file into a Sponge schematic:

```sh
python3 main.py input.nbs output.schem
```

Be sure to tell me if something ain't right, e.g. by opening an [issue](https://github.com/4321ba/Galaxy_Jukebox/issues)!

## Current state

The program is feature complete, but there are some some more things I may want to do.

## Minecraft version

The program currently needs 1.14 for:

- scaffolding (for the 1gt delay, there are [other designs too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0xOAOM_R0Y), but this seems the best)
- smooth granite/andesite slab (aesthetics)
- birch sign (because we need 1.14, the sign has to have a woodtype)
- all the noteblock sounds (there isn't any check present whether they are available)
- 1.13 is maybe needed for the .schem support (and blockstates) in WorldEdit/etc., idk
- 1.13 for jungle wood

## Performance

It is bad, though not as terrible as it used to be. It takes 2-30 seconds for one song, depending on the song complexity. Much improvement could be made by rewriting `builder.get_delay_length` to use raw math instead of building the whole thing with `builder.build_delay` and then throwing it away.
